        <h3>I wanted to take Mobile-friendly websites because I want to make web development my career. I had zero knowledge of coding or much of anything on how computers worked, but I took the first class and fell in love with it. Now, I want to work as a web developer because it excites me and allows me to be creative while also providing a way to pay the bills. I can't wait to learn more and take more classes!</h3>
